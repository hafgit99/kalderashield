/* Writes one static document per locale.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The site used to have a single URL per page and swap the language with
 * JavaScript. That is fine for a visitor and useless to a search engine: twelve
 * languages shared one address, so a crawler indexed whichever one it happened
 * to render, and no page could ever be linked to in a specific language. A
 * Turkish reader with a link to the German download page had nowhere to send
 * it.
 *
 * The unprefixed URLs stay as they are and remain Turkish, which is the language
 * the hand-written pages ship in and the source the dictionaries are written
 * against. The other eleven get their own prefix. That keeps every existing
 * internal link and canonical valid -- there are no relative links in the
 * markup, so nothing has to be rewritten to survive the extra directory level --
 * and it avoids needing a redirect on "/", which a static host cannot serve.
 *
 * How a localized page is produced
 * --------------------------------
 * By applying assets/js/i18n-apply.js to the document with that locale's
 * dictionary -- the same code the browser runs, not a second implementation of
 * it. The output therefore needs no JavaScript to be readable, which is the
 * point: a crawler that does not execute scripts gets the right language
 * instead of the Turkish default.
 *
 * The pages carry their language in `lang`/`dir` and point `canonical` at
 * themselves, and each one lists every other locale through hreflang so the
 * twelve are recognised as translations of one page rather than as twelve
 * pages competing with each other.
